# ProtocolLimits

## Purpose

Limits applied to protocol definitions, payload collections, literal text, and JSON representation.

## Declaration and ownership

- **Declaration:** public static class `ProtocolLimits`.
- **Source:** [ProtocolLimits.cs](ProtocolLimits.cs).
- **Responsibility:** Centralizes explicit, testable representation limits so callers can reason about bounded input.
- **Non-goals:** These constants do not establish semantic validity, authorization, or execution safety.

## Contract and use

The public constants are enforced by the owning constructors/builders. Treat them as part of the current representation contract; do not silently bypass them in host adapters.

## Verification

See the package test project for boundary and over-limit regression cases.
