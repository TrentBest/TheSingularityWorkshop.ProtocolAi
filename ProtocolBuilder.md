# ProtocolBuilder

## Purpose

Authoring surface for an immutable protocol definition.

## Declaration and ownership

- **Declaration:** public sealed class ProtocolBuilder.
- **Source:** [ProtocolBuilder.cs](ProtocolBuilder.cs).
- **Related source types:** ProtocolDefinition; ProtocolSymbol.
- **Responsibilities:** Accumulates symbol declarations through Define and creates a ProtocolDefinition through Build.
- **Non-goals:** Duplicate identities, names, and values are rejected by the definition boundary when Build constructs it.

## Contract and use

The protocol vocabulary is application-owned. IDs are unsigned 64-bit identities and a symbol address is qualified by its protocol ID. Known values can be encoded as references; unknown values remain explicit literals instead of being assigned invented IDs.

## Verification

Relevant tests: [tests/ProtocolAi.Tests/ProtocolDefinitionTests.cs](tests/ProtocolAi.Tests/ProtocolDefinitionTests.cs). This guide is source-authored and checked against the current public declaration; it is not generated from reflection or compiler AST.
